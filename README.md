# hello-world
My first repository on Github. From this repository, I am going to build my profile as a "data scientist".
Well, some first lines on README
I just have a primitive idea of what is Github and what is Git, LCI. I think it is often that people know and understand the needs of having Github, LCI, Git, then they get to the softwares and Github websites. My situation is quite in the opposite way. I stumbled upon a course on Coursera when finding courses related to my statistics course at school. 

I come to realize that art is an essensial part of my life. I do not have an academic view about art, but I do have appreciation towards the pictures, the music compositions, the photos, the designs, and the artists that happen to reach my petty life.
